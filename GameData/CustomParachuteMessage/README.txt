A Kerbals Space Program MOD by Icecovery

Custom Parachute Message is a Kerbal Space Program mod that adds a perseverance style customizable parachutes with a cool shader!

This mod REQUIRES RealChute Parachute System to work
This mod REQUIRES Module Manager to work

How to Use:
Enter action group editing mode.
Open the RealChute's parachutes config menu on a parachute.
Select "Encoded" as the chute model in the RealChute config menu.
If "Encoded" is not an option under "Chute Model", then this parachute is not supported.
After selecting the "Encoded" chute model, exit action group editing mode, right-click on the parachute part, press the "Toggle Customization Window" button.
A "Customize Parachute" window should pop up, a preview model will also appear on the north wall of the VAB. Noted that this parachute does not reflect the actual size of the parachute, change that in the RealChute config menu. The "Flat Preview Model" toggle will let you choose whether use the flat preview model instead of the 3D preview model.
Customize the parachute as you wish, any change will be automatically saved if the "Auto Update" toggle is On. If you encounter any performance issue (unlikely to happen unless you are running on a potato) when editing the parachute, turn off "Auto Update", and remember to click the "Update" button to save the change.
UI features: 
Color selection: Click on a color selection button will reveal or switch to the color parameters for the corresponding color, click on the same button again will hide the color parameters. You can copy and paste the hexadecimal color value (must start with '#') to the Hex text field under RGB slider, or you can paste the full name of a color in English to that text field, which will translate the name to a hexadecimal color value.
Editing modes: There are two editing modes, Standard and Bitwise.
Standard mode: encode your message using the same method to encode the message on perseverance's parachute. If you switch Off the "Ring 4 is coordinate" toggle, the coordinate will become the fourth word, encoded the same way as Ring 1 - 3. You should only use the regular Latin alphabet in the Words text field, no space is allowed in each word. Each word must not exceed 8 characters long. There are also some presets for you to choose from under the preset section.
Bitwise mode: set value for each individual section(bit) on the parachute. There are 4 rings, each ring with 80 strips, therefore there are in total 320 bits on the parachute. You can copy the code for the current pattern under the Pattern code section, you can also paste the code in the text field that has "Load" and "Clear" buttons beside it, and click the "Load" button to load the pattern from the code. You can share your parachute design with your friend or clone patterns between parachutes using these features. There is no global memory for custom patterns, save the pattern code on external storage media (e.g. "MyCoolChutePatterns.txt"). There some presets for this mode as well, located under the presets section. Under the "Set bit individually" section you can toggle each of the 320 bits however you wish.
